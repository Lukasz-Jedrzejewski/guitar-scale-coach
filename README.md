# Guitar-scale-coach

The main goal when creating an application is to improve programming skills in pure Java. 
An idea born out of a passion for programming and guitar.

An application whose idea is to help beginner guitarists learn guitar scales and navigate the guitar fretboard.
My dream is to ultimately combine the functionalities of websites such as https://www.songsterr.com/ or 
https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/ and the Guitar Pro application - https://www.guitar-pro.com .
